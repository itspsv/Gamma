# Gamma

# Steps

# 1.Data Preprocessing:
- Import necessary libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, and imblearn.
- Load the dataset and perform data cleaning (if necessary).
# 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyze key features and their distributions.
- Visualize correlations and trends using plots.
# 3.Modeling:
- Apply machine learning techniques to classify events.
- Use oversampling methods (e.g., RandomOverSampler) to handle class imbalance
# 4.Evaluation:
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
